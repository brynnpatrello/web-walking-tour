1,Machinery Row,,43.0759999,-89.3754289,"<p> Welcome to Machinery Row! If this architecture seems familiar to you, that is because this building was designed by the same architects who designed the Red Gym on the UW-Madison campus: Alan Conover and Lew Porter. Machinery Row is part of the National Register of Historic Places. The site's original purpose was to provide businesses with a location nearby to a railroad depot in the 'Implement Row' district. Today it functions as a bicycle shop- quite fitting for Madison's love of biking.</p><p>Historic preservation, of places like Machinery Row, establishes how a place's identity came to be. ""Old places foster community by giving people a sense of shared identity through landmarks, history, memory, and stories, by having the attributes that foster community, such as distinctive character and walkability, and by serving as shared places where people meet and gather."" (Savingplaces.org). Historic sites are a way of saying, ""We are here, and we have been here."" As part of the entrance into the Willy St neighborhood, Machinery Row serves as an obvious tie into the greater Madison community, connected through the city-wide love of biking. It also represents the longevity of the community, with the building existing since the late 1800s. Historic sites, like Machinery Row, play an important role in shaping the landscape and establishing landmarks that form the identity of the community and surrounding area.</p><p><i>Credits:</i><br></br><a href=""https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/GetAsset/NRHP/82000654_text"">National Register of Historic Places Inventory- Nomination Form</a><br></br><a href=""https://savingplaces.org/stories/why-do-old-places-matter?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIoa3FhuzoiQMVSDQIBR1yewmuEAAYASAAEgLotfD_BwE"">Savingplaces.org</a>",<b>Machinery Row</b><br></br>Start your tour at the southeast corner of Williamson St and S Blair St,machineryrow.png
2,CommuniTree,,43.0763665,-89.3744894,"<p>This sculpture is titled ""CommuniTree,"" created by Aaron Howard and Erika Koivunen, and was installed in 2014. The artists and planning board intended this sculpture to serve as a gateway to the Williamson Street Community. As evident in the name, the idea of community is reflected in its title and creation. Inside the tree also includes a time capsule with various items representing Williamson Street culture.</p><p>However, community-focused projects sometimes don't turn out how they were intended to be. The CommuniTree received some negative backlash from the community, with some residents believing the project was expensive, didn't look like its proposed rendering, and looks like a giant toilet brush. With the sculpture serving as the identifying gateway to the neighborhood, residents did not want a toilet brush representing what their community is all about.</p><p>Furthermore, the sculpture was vandalized in 2014 with a spray-painted yellow dot. The dot was intended to resemble the markings the city puts on trees they plan to remove. This also shows how vandalism and art reflect a community's priorities and concerns. The act of vandalism demonstrates the distaste for the removal of nature by the community, almost making the sculpture more representative of the community with its vandalization.</p><p>This comes to show that regarding placemaking, if the space does not represent the community's identity, the community will make themselves known in other ways. This emphasizes the importance of including community voices in all steps of a planning process.</p><p><i>Credits:</i><br></br><a href=""https://captimes.com/news/local/city-life/the-peoples-art-madisons-new-public-art-takes-inspiration-from-the-community/article_3aaa5a13-ce17-57e0-9f29-8b029c8cf2e4.html"">The Cap Times- News Article</a><br></br><a href=""https://willystreetblog.com/wp/2014/09/16/cummunitree-vandalized-by-cowardly-art-critics/"">Willy Street Blog- Post</a>",<b>CommuniTree</b><br></br>Follow the sidewalk NE along Willy St. Look to the median in the street.,communitree.png
3,Utility Box Project,,43.0773209,-89.372579,"<p>You might have spotted any of the 60+ utility boxes across Madison that are a part of Madison's Utility Box Art Program, by the Friends of Madison Arts Commission. This citywide project aims to sponsor Madison artists by providing them an unlikely canvas- utility boxes. Though a necessary part of public infrastructure, the metallic clunkiness of the utility box can be somewhat of an eyesore in the context of placemaking. To turn that around, Madison calls upon local artists to highlight their artwork through the wrapping of these boxes. While elevating these spaces, the project also allows community identity to shine through. Real locals get to contribute to their own community, showcasing perspectives and interpretations of the personality and identity of the space they are creating for.</p><p>The artwork on this box in particular is titled ""Disco Party"" by Shiloah Symone Coley, a 2020 graduate from UW-Madison. Coley evokes the sense of fun through the bright colors related to a fun event- a disco. The form of the art also draws inspiration from her comic art style, an outlet which she states allows her to explore her identity as a black woman. This further relates to her research regarding race and the expression of art, and how silenced voices make their presence known in their communities through means like graffiti. Through participation in the Utility Box Art Program, she further establishes the presence of silenced voices in the Madison/Willy St community. She also participated in the State St Mural Project, also associated with the Friends of Madison Arts Commission, acknowledging these efforts as a way for her to personally give back to her community.</p><p><i>Credits:</i><br></br><a href=""https://www.friendsofmadisonarts.org/utility-boxes.html"">Friends of Madison Arts Commission- Utility Box Program</a><br></br><a href=""https://uwalumni.com/news/badgering-shiloah-coley-20/"">Interview with Shiloah Coley</a><br></br><a href=""https://www.cityofmadison.com/dpced/planning/documents/Utility_Box_Art_Program2018.pdf"">City of Madison Call for Entries- Utility Box Program</a>",<b>Utility Box Project</b><br></br>Stay on this sidewalk and walk NE toward Williamson/Jenifer St,utilityboxes.png
