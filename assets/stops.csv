1,Machinery Row,,43.0759999,-89.3754289,"<p> Welcome to Machinery Row! If this architecture seems familiar to you, that is because this building was designed by the same architects who designed the Red Gym on the UW-Madison campus: Alan Conover and Lew Porter. Machinery Row is part of the National Register of Historic Places. The site's original purpose was to provide businesses with a location nearby to a railroad depot in the 'Implement Row' district. Today it functions as a bicycle shop- quite fitting for Madison's love of biking.</p><p>Historic preservation, of places like Machinery Row, establishes how a place's identity came to be. ""Old places foster community by giving people a sense of shared identity through landmarks, history, memory, and stories, by having the attributes that foster community, such as distinctive character and walkability, and by serving as shared places where people meet and gather."" (Savingplaces.org). Historic sites are a way of saying, ""We are here, and we have been here."" As part of the entrance into the Willy St neighborhood, Machinery Row serves as an obvious tie into the greater Madison community, connected through the city-wide love of biking. It also represents the longevity of the community, with the building existing since the late 1800s. Historic sites, like Machinery Row, play an important role in shaping the landscape and establishing landmarks that form the identity of the community and surrounding area.</p><p><i>Credits:</i><br></br><a href=""https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/GetAsset/NRHP/82000654_text"">National Register of Historic Places Inventory- Nomination Form</a><br></br><a href=""https://savingplaces.org/stories/why-do-old-places-matter?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIoa3FhuzoiQMVSDQIBR1yewmuEAAYASAAEgLotfD_BwE"">Savingplaces.org</a>",<b>Machinery Row</b><br></br>Start your tour at the southeast corner of Williamson St and S Blair St,machineryrow.png
2,CommuniTree,,43.0763665,-89.3744894,"<p>This sculpture is titled ""CommuniTree,"" created by Aaron Howard and Erika Koivunen, and was installed in 2014. The artists and planning board intended this sculpture to serve as a gateway to the Williamson Street Community. As evident in the name, the idea of community is reflected in its title and creation. Inside the tree also includes a time capsule with various items representing Williamson Street culture.</p><p>However, community-focused projects sometimes don't turn out how they were intended to be. The CommuniTree received some negative backlash from the community, with some residents believing the project was expensive, didn't look like its proposed rendering, and looks like a giant toilet brush. With the sculpture serving as the identifying gateway to the neighborhood, residents did not want a toilet brush representing what their community is all about.</p><p>Furthermore, the sculpture was vandalized in 2014 with a spray-painted yellow dot. The dot was intended to resemble the markings the city puts on trees they plan to remove. This also shows how vandalism and art reflect a community's priorities and concerns. The act of vandalism demonstrates the distaste for the removal of nature by the community, almost making the sculpture more representative of the community with its vandalization.</p><p>This comes to show that regarding placemaking, if the space does not represent the community's identity, the community will make themselves known in other ways. This emphasizes the importance of including community voices in all steps of a planning process.</p><p><i>Credits:</i><br></br><a href=""https://captimes.com/news/local/city-life/the-peoples-art-madisons-new-public-art-takes-inspiration-from-the-community/article_3aaa5a13-ce17-57e0-9f29-8b029c8cf2e4.html"">The Cap Times- News Article</a><br></br><a href=""https://willystreetblog.com/wp/2014/09/16/cummunitree-vandalized-by-cowardly-art-critics/"">Willy Street Blog- Post</a>",<b>CommuniTree</b><br></br>Follow the sidewalk NE along Willy St. Look to the median in the street.,communitree.png
3,Utility Box Project,,43.0773209,-89.372579,"<p>You might have spotted any of the 60+ utility boxes across Madison that are a part of Madison's Utility Box Art Program, by the Friends of Madison Arts Commission. This citywide project aims to sponsor Madison artists by providing them an unlikely canvas- utility boxes. Though a necessary part of public infrastructure, the metallic clunkiness of the utility box can be somewhat of an eyesore in the context of placemaking. To turn that around, Madison calls upon local artists to highlight their artwork through the wrapping of these boxes. While elevating these spaces, the project also allows community identity to shine through. Real locals get to contribute to their own community, showcasing perspectives and interpretations of the personality and identity of the space they are creating for.</p><p>The artwork on this box in particular is titled ""Disco Party"" by Shiloah Symone Coley, a 2020 graduate from UW-Madison. Coley evokes the sense of fun through the bright colors related to a fun event- a disco. The form of the art also draws inspiration from her comic art style, an outlet which she states allows her to explore her identity as a black woman. This further relates to her research regarding race and the expression of art, and how silenced voices make their presence known in their communities through means like graffiti. Through participation in the Utility Box Art Program, she further establishes the presence of silenced voices in the Madison/Willy St community. She also participated in the State St Mural Project, also associated with the Friends of Madison Arts Commission, acknowledging these efforts as a way for her to personally give back to her community.</p><p><i>Credits:</i><br></br><a href=""https://www.friendsofmadisonarts.org/utility-boxes.html"">Friends of Madison Arts Commission- Utility Box Program</a><br></br><a href=""https://uwalumni.com/news/badgering-shiloah-coley-20/"">Interview with Shiloah Coley</a><br></br><a href=""https://www.cityofmadison.com/dpced/planning/documents/Utility_Box_Art_Program2018.pdf"">City of Madison Call for Entries- Utility Box Program</a>",<b>Utility Box Project</b><br></br>Stay on this sidewalk and walk NE toward Williamson/Jenifer St,utilityboxes.png
4,Wagner Park,,43.0774338,-89.3722964,"<p>Welcome to R. Richard Wagner Park! It wasn't always named this though. Its original name was the Kerr-McGee Park. In July 2022, the community supported changing the name of the park in honor of Dick Wagner, a local community member with a passion for parks and community spaces. Public comments in support of the renaming describe Wagner as a passionate person with a strong sense of pride for the communities he was a part of, in addition to citing the numerous hours of service to the Olbrich Botanical Society. Unfortunately, Wagner passed on December 12, 2021, though his legacy lives on through a community space named in his honor, reflecting a life well-lived and in service to his community.</p> <p>This public effort on behalf of Wagner's legacy comes to show how communities value a representative space. Willy St has always been defined by a sense of community, and that is reflected through the people the community chooses to honor. Having chosen to honor someone who lived a life in service to his community demonstrates that valuation of cultivating a sense of community among Willy St residents.</p><p>You'll also notice some pretty cool public art in Wagner Park! This sculpture is titled ""Alexa"" by Susan Walsh. Erected in 1992, the sculpture honors the industrial roots of the Willy St community and the history including Implement Row. Using recycled pieces, this sculpture demonstrates a community value of sustainability and hard work.</p><p><i>Credits:</i><br></br><a href=""https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5700699&GUID=C597403F-7AE9-42BE-A31F-6EDD1CA3101B"">Wagner Park Legislative Ruling</a><br></br><a href=""https://www.friendsofmadisonarts.org/outdoor-public-art.html"">Friends of Madison Arts Commission- Outdoor Public Art Database</a><br></br><a href=""https://www.visitmadison.com/blog/stories/post/public-art-seen-on-the-lake-monona-loop/"">Destination Madison Article</a><br></br><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/159700503902/posts/10161301033793903/?_rdr"">Public Comment via Facebook by Susan Walsh</a>",<b>Wagner Park</b><br></br>On the same corner as the utility box.,wagnerpark.png
5,Madison Candy Co,,43.0779919,-89.3720476,"<p>As the name suggests, Madison Candy Company was a confectionary manufacturer at this location from 1899-1927. The business sold goods like crackers, cigars, cheese, and nuts, but were most well known for their chocolate cr&egrave;mes. Like many other locations in Implement Row, this factory was a direct result of the booming industry at the time.</p><p>The architect of the building was John Nader, and the building got added to the National and State Register of Historic Places in 1997 and 1996 respectively. Today, businesses like Ahan (southeast Asian restaurant), InSite Consulting Architects (ICA), and Legal Action of Wisconsin occupy the premises while maintaining its historic fa&ccedil;ade.</p><p>In 1997, a man named John Martens worked to restore the iconic, but fading, mural on the side of the building. Though the intention was to make it more readable and return the signs vibrancy, they also intentionally used a concrete stain in order to maintain that worn, historical look. (The Cap Times).</p><p>This goes to show how a community values its historic representation. The community could have easily let the sign fade into the brick. However, they recognized the significance of the location and connection to the community's industrial roots, motivating the mural's restoration. Additionally, they could have also restored it to look shiny and new. Martens mentioned traditionally using opaque paint for restoration projects like such. Instead, they opted to maintain the historical feel of the sign.</p><p>Historic preservation is an important component to a community's identity- stating ""We are here! And we've been here!"" Maintaining the worn texture of the sign helps to reinforce that.</p><p><i>Credits:</i><br></br><a href=""https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/NationalRegister/NR1519"">Wisconsin Historical Society- National/State Registers Record</a><br></br><a href=""https://captimes.com/news/local/city-life/historic-gallagher-tent-and-awning-ghost-sign-disappears-under-a-coat-of-paint/article_7a9b4657-4203-5983-9771-61ae3f6f56cc.html"">The Cap Times Article</a>","<b>Madison Candy Co</b><br></br>You can see the sign from the right side of the road, looking toward the other side of the street, as you continue walking NE.<br><br/>It it not needed for the tour, but if you choose to take a closer look, the closest crosswalk is either Williamson &#64; Jenifer St (backtracking), or Williamson &#64; S Livingston St (at the end of the block)",madisoncandyco.png
6,King Midas Flour,,43.0793817,-89.3696715,"<p>After a fire burned down the original structure, the Biederstadt-Breitenbach Grocery store tooks its place in 1874, which also doubled as the home for both families. Biederstadt-Breitenbach Grocery was a popular spot for dry goods, feed, china, and glassware. With strong ties to Madison, the Biederstadt family also built the Majestic Theatre in 1906.</p><p>The mural itself is an advertisement for a flour product. There is not a lot of information about the mural, but the assumption is that Krause Grocery & Meats, a building occupant after the Biederstadt-Breitenbach Grocery closed down in the 1950s, can be attributed.</p><p>This mural also underwent restoration efforts by the owner of Madison business, Cargo Coffee. Additionally, the building is also a registered historical marker.</p><p>Willy St operated as a thoroughfare in these times, drawing the business of passer-throughs. This is yet another tie to the industrial roots of Willy St which is evident the community is proud of. The mural acts as a symbol of the Willy Street community identity, grounded in its rich history.</p><p><i>Credits:</i><br></br><a href=""https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=33233"">The Historical Marker Database</a><br></br><a href=""https://608today.6amcity.com/ghost-signs-willy-street-madison-wi"">608 Today Article</a></p>",<b>King Midas Flour</b><br></br>Walk NE and stop at the crosswalk across S Paterson St. Look to your SW.,kingmidas.png
7,LOVE Mural,,43.0802375,-89.3690097,"<p>Michael Owen, mural artist, started the LOVE Mural Project in Baltimore, with 20 love-based murals painted. When the project expanded, Owen sought out Madison as his next canvas. To Owen's surprise, years after the mural's installation, the building's management asked him to return to update the mural after the building underwent repairs. This was apparently an uncommon request for Owen which he was happy to fulfill.</p><p>Owen stated that when he revisited the mural, he took the opportunity to ask community members about the mural's meaning to them. He found it was seen as a beacon of connection, encouraging love in a divided world. One community member even mentioned her daughter wanted to take senior photos in front of the wall, demonstrating the sense of identity this mural has fostered.</p><p>See the above picture for the original and updated version of the Madison LOVE Mural.</p><p>The LOVE Mural is yet another example how community involvement in the artistic process, in the context of an environment with strong community ties, can transform a space for the better.</p><p><i>Credits:</i><br></br><a href=""https://www.channel3000.com/lifestyle/restoration-underway-on-love-mural-on-side-of-williamson-st-building/article_e4587079-e2d1-52ad-8bff-7be32e5ffed0.html"">Channel 3000 Article</a></p>","<b>LOVE Mural</b><br></br>Cross Williamson and Paterson to get to the left side of the road, heading NE.
